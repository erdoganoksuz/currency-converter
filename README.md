# How to use ?
1. Install dependencies with `yarn`
2. Start development env with `yarn start`
3. Run linter with `yarn lint`
4. Run prettier with `yarn prettier`
   
# Improvement of the project
1. Using `Intl` object for getting users language and currency type would be good.
2. Add some unit and integration test. Cypress would be good.
3. Multiple conversion is easy to develop feature but the main problem is design and UX.
4. Timer for latest update date.
5. Design is so minimal colors would be good.
6. Advance level calculation
7. Error handling, I created a api context for this.
